## Mario's Italian Restaurant

Mario is opening a new restaurant in Edinburgh and needs your help getting it organised.

### MVP:

- The restaurant should have a name and budget
- Patrons can come and eat at the restaurant. They will be added to a table when they come in to eat.
- Patrons can order from a menu. It should consist of dishes that have prices and ingredients.
- Mario wants to be able to calculate the total price for each table and add it to the budget of the restaurant when the patron pay.
- After paying, patrons are removed from the table to make room for the next ones.

### Extensions:

- Patrons can split up the bill and pay individually
- Dishes can be customised for dietary needs
- Add a kitchen that gets ingredients delivered and has a pantry to keep them.
- Ingredients are removed when dishes are ordered (hint: customised dishes use different ingredients)
- When the kitchen runs out of an ingredient, all dishes using that ingredient have to be removed from the menu
- And/or anything else that you can think of...

### Technology used:

- Java
- JUnit
- Android Studio


## Moving Forward

Moving forward I would like to work on finishing the split bill extensions and practice UI design through android studio.


## Problems encountered/lessons learned:

- Initially, I was attempting to do too much functionality in a single method. Learned to split up methods into smaller chunks so that they are not only easier to understand/create, but also allows for code to be reused and tested more easily. If code is more reusable, it certainly cuts down on development time later in a project.

- Test Driven Development (TDD) was initally very hard to understand for me. I couldn't quite grasp the concept. After this project I massively increased my understanding of testing (e.g. files like RestaurantTest.java had much more testing required than I was used to, so it taught me quite a lot)
